# scattering-emulators
A repository used to compare the KVP and NVP emulators for two-body scattering in momentum space. This code was used to generate results for the paper ''Wave function-based emulation for nucleon-nucleon scattering in momentum space'' by Garcia, Drischler, Furnstahl, Melendez, and Zhang.
